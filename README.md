# Recommended configurations

We recommend using a relatively modern device with a high-resolution camera. It is also nice to have a camera with a high aperture to allow for brighter photos in the dark.

# Build process

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

For this project, we chose to use YOLOv7 as our main object detector. YOLOv7 was chosen because it offers excellent documentation and more importantly: it offers great image recognition whilst still working on low-end hardware. The other YOLO versions can simply not compete with YOLOv7 in terms of speed and accuracy. At first, the idea was to create our own image recognition software, but after a short period, we realized that we were wasting our time and that using YOLO was much faster to develop with.
